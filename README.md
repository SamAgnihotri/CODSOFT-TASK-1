PROJECT- TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
QUESTION: Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
project with readily available data.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information
about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
OBECTIVE: In this task i'm useing the python language to complete this task by using so many libraries like pandas etc.

OVERVIWE OF THE PROJECT: Overview of the Titanic Survival Prediction Project
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, using data from the well-known Kaggle dataset. This project helps in applying machine learning techniques to a binary classification problem. Here's a breakdown of the key steps involved:

1. Data Collection
You will use the Titanic dataset, which includes information on passengers such as:
Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass (Passenger Class: 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Sex (Gender)
Age
SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
Fare (Ticket price)
Cabin (Cabin number, often incomplete)
Embarked (Port of Embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
2. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values: Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns may contain missing data.
Feature Engineering: Convert categorical data (like Sex, Embarked) into numerical values for machine learning models.
Normalization: Scale features like age and fare to standardize the data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize data: Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand the distribution of different variables.
Correlation analysis: Identify which features are correlated with survival.
4. Model Building
Train-test split: Divide the data into training and testing sets.
Model selection: Use various machine learning algorithms to predict survival, such as:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Hyperparameter tuning: Improve the model's performance by optimizing parameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics such as:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
ROC-AUC curve
6. Conclusion
Based on the results, you will summarize the key insights and findings, such as which factors (gender, age, class) had the most impact on survival rates.
